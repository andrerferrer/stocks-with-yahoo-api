WHAT WE DO (in english)
1st we get the input from the form
then, we take that input and we send to the api
then, the api will give us a response back
then, we will take parts of that response
then, with those parts, we will update the DOM

WHAT WE DO (in pseudocode)
1. select the element (FORM)
2. add event listener (SUBMIT)*
3. do behavior (CALL THE API)
  1. find the input that the user has provided
  2. with that input fetch the api and receive a response
    1. we will dig the response for useful information
    2. with that useful information we will update the DOM
    3. select the element that we want to update
    4. update that element

* The event SUBMIT only happens on FORM.

ALWAYS START WITH
  // call the API
  fetch(url)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
      // understand what data is
      console.log(data);
    });
